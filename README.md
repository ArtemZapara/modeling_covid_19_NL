The objective of this project was to estimate how fast the epidemic curve in the Netherlands will flatten out based on the historical data.

The code in the modeling_COVID_NL.ipynb file performs simple mathematical modeling of the outbreak. Almost all critical lines are well-documented. The data_2020-04-06.csv file contains all relevant information as of 6th April, 2020.
